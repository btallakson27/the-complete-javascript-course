// This chapter focuses on Object Oriented Programming, better known as OOP

// 1. Write a JavaScript class named Rectangle that has two properties, width and height, and initialized through its constructor. 
// Then create a method that gets added to the prototype (original version) of the class and calculates the area. 
// Next, instantiate an object of Rectangle with a width of 5 and a height of 10.
// Finally, show how all instances of Rectangle can access the method above. 
// instantiate: to represent or be an example of something. basically it's a word or number.

// 2. How do you create a constructor within a class named Circle that initializes a property radius and sets its value based on 
// the argument passed when a new Circle instance is created? Create an instance of Circle with a radius of 4.
// 90% mastery



// 3. In the context of a class method in JavaScript, what does the "this" keyword refer to, and how would you use it inside 
// a method named describe in a class Person to access the instance's properties named name and age?
// 80% mastery



// 4. Create a class named Animal with a constructor that initializes a property species. Then, define a subclass named Dog 
// that inherits from Animal and adds an additional property name in its constructor. How do instances of Dog access methods 
// defined on Animal's prototype?
